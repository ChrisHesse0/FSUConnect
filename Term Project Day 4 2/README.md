                                            Problem Description
Our term project is a new social networking application that is exclusively for Florida State University students. Normally student's struggle to find strong study partner, but our application, FSULink, allows students to connect with one another to increase their personal networking skills, and more importantly make friends with similar personal interests! With FSULink, students can create profiles including their FSUID, current major, graduating year, etc. Moreover, our user-friendly interface allows students to quickly parse through a stream of other student users and identify potential study partners based of similar majors, and graduation year!Student's simply have to make an account, and once logged in, can parse through a stream of other FSU users until they find their anticipated match!With FSULink's default package, user's can contact other students through their FSUID. However, with our Silver Package, users can comment on others post, and Gold can even message student's on FSULink! As a team, we are excited to potentially integrate this application into FSU students's daily lives!

                                        User Interface Instructions
FSULink's user interface is incredibly friendly, allowing college students to connect with other students stress free! Our application prompts the user to login using their username and password(or signup if they dont have an account). Upon logging in, the user will be able to click through a stream of FSU student's accounts, and either like or dislike a users page. Once a user likes a student, that student will not appear in the users stream again. In conclusion, FSULink has a simple, friendly, user interface that allows for students to connect with others with ease.

                                      Additional Feature Implementation
Our additional feature implementation deals with the different versions FSULink has to offer. Our default version of FSULink is the bronze package. This version of FSULink allows users to parse through the stream of users, as well as like and di
like accounts. However, their is no form of contact through the app. If a user wishes to reach out to a user, they can email them at their respective fsu emails using their FSUID on their account. The second version of FSULink is the silver version. A silver version of FSULink has all of the features a bronze user has, plus the ability to comment on a users page. 
If the user recipient is a bronze user, they can still view the comment, but cannot make one of their own. The third version of FSULink is the gold version. This version has all the features of bronze and silver, plus the ability to message another user! However, only two Gold User's can converse with one another on FSULink. Those are FSULink's three versions, and their different features!
